# Tutorials Inspired by book: O'Reilly Rust Programming - Fast, Safe Systems Development

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## [Simple Actix Web Server]()  
In this video we create a simple but updated version of a web server from page 17 of the book.  
[Here]() is the code.

[WASI Programming Part 4 Hello World(and more) With Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw5L8HrHGTw)  
In this video we continue with our Node.js Javascript runner from Part 3, but this time we run **WASI**, not just WASM.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-4) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 4.
