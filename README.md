# Tutorials Inspired by book: O'Reilly Programming Rust - Fast, Safe Systems Development

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

In this video we create a simple but updated version of a web server from page 17 of the book.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/book-rust-prog-sys-dev-tutorials-play-1-num-3) is the code.
